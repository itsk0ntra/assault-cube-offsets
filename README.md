# assault-cube-offsets
offsets vor assault cube version 1.1.0.4

Why am I giving it away?

Before I knew how to get offsets I searched on the internet but didn't find any, so now I'm giving it out to y'all.

# Offsets
Here are some offsets(i know these are not really offsets, but if you know how to use it, they'll work + you don't need a base adress if you use them):

Ammo = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 14C

Pistol = ac_client.exe+000E4DBC, 138

Sub Machine Gun = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 144

Sniper = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 148

Shotgun = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 140

Carbine = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 140

Grenade = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, 154

Health = ac_client.exe+000DF73C, F4


Enjoy
